 *                       throughput testing. Generates an uncompressed BMP
 *                       image on the fly (no data is stored in flash/RAM),
 *                       byte-for-byte reproducible on the host side for
 *                       correctness verification. Identical interface to
 *                       ../../ch32l103/User/filexfer.[ch].
